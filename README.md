What I have beeen working on. 
Runways
Runway Lights
Taxiways
Taxiways Lights, Lines and Labeling
Aprons
Lighing- I have added some lighting to the airport so you can see at night.
Gates are still a work in progress. Although they are all hooked up(labed and connect to taxiways) The Panintelines are not complete as well as the labeling is not correct. It's a working progress
I added an Homage to FS by adding a FS Apron with all of the MSFS Club Planes and the FS Hanger from LAX
The Large East Cargo Apron is started and has working ramps. Again Work in progress.

Much more too much to list.
